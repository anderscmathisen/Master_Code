## Multislice CBED and PED simulations with Py_multislice (Pyms)

This directory contains code to do multislice CBED and PED simulatitons with Pyms, and code to compare results with experimental SPED.

The PED simulations is made with PED_sim.py, and CBED with CBED_sim.py.

The results of these may be converted to .hspy files with Convert2Hspy.ipynb

CompareWithExperiment.ipynb shows how the PED simulation is compared with SPED data.
